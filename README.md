# vee-validate experiments

Using field arrays, yup for validation, plain HTML (no \<Field\> component).

- src/Simple.vue: basic example using yup
- src/Interdependent.vue: same error on multiple interdependent fields (fields must be coherent with each other)
- src/NoDuplication.vue: field arrays that cross-validate each other
- src/File.vue: file upload basic example
- src/FileArray.vue: file upload with field arrays and custom validation using yup
